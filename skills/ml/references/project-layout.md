# ML Project Layout

A run is reproducible only when its code, its configuration, and its data are each independently pinned — the layout below enforces that separation structurally, so reproducibility does not depend on anyone remembering to be careful.

## Greenfield defaults

For a new Python ML project, start with a `pyproject.toml`, a locked dependency resolution (for example, `uv.lock`), and importable training code (commonly a `src/<pkg>/` layout). `uv` is the default recipe here because it combines locking and execution; another installed, team-standard environment manager is equally valid when the project already uses one. These defaults make a result reproducible without requiring an unrelated incumbent project to migrate.

A lockfile pins resolved versions, while an importable package keeps reusable pipeline logic out of notebooks and ad hoc entrypoints. Preserve an established project's dependency declaration, lockfile, environment manager, and package layout during feature or experiment work; propose a migration only as its own scoped change.

### Artifact placement (MECE)

| Artifact | Belongs in | Never in |
|---|---|---|
| Reusable data loading, model definitions, training loop, eval metrics | `src/<pkg>/{data,models,training,eval}/` | `notebooks/`, `scripts/` |
| A run's hyperparameters | `configs/<name>.yaml`, committed alongside its result | hardcoded inside `training/`, CLI-flags-only with no saved record |
| Source-of-truth raw data | `data/raw/` (immutable after ingest) | edited in place, mixed with derived data |
| Cleaned/derived/split data | `data/interim/`, `data/processed/` | `data/raw/` |
| One-off exploration | `notebooks/NN-topic.ipynb`, numbered | logic imported back into `src/` |
| Thin CLI entrypoints | `scripts/<name>.py`, calling into `src/<pkg>/` | business logic living in the script body itself |
| Run outputs (checkpoints, logs, metrics, plots) | `experiments/<run-id>/`, gitignored | committed into the repository |
| Tests | `tests/` mirroring `src/<pkg>/` — see the `principle-testing` skill for suite-level structure | scattered per-module `tests/` directories |

### Scripts stay thin

A file under `scripts/` calls into `src/<pkg>/` — it does not re-implement the pipeline inline. The same 250-pure-LOC ceiling the `principle-programming` skill applies to every source file applies here too; a script that grows past it has quietly become the real implementation.

```bash
awk '!/^[[:space:]]*$/ && !/^[[:space:]]*#/' scripts/train.py | wc -l
```

Pass: a small number of lines — argument parsing, config loading, one call into `src/<pkg>/`. Fail: the count approaches or crosses 250 — the logic grew into the script instead of a `src/<pkg>/` module.

**SMELL — the script re-implements the training loop inline:**

```python
# scripts/train.py
df = pd.read_csv("data/processed/train.csv")
model = SomeModel(hidden_dim=256)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
for epoch in range(100):
    for batch in make_batches(df):
        loss = model.step(batch)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
# … dozens more lines of training logic live here, untested and unreusable
```

**CLEAN — the script is a thin entrypoint:**

```python
# scripts/train.py
from mypkg.training.config import load_config
from mypkg.training.loop import run_training

def main() -> None:
    cfg = load_config("configs/exp-004.yaml")
    run_training(cfg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `run_training` function above lives in `src/mypkg/training/`, is importable, and is testable in isolation — none of which is true of logic trapped inside a `scripts/` file.

### `data/raw/` is immutable

Once ingested, a file in `data/raw/` is never edited, reformatted, or overwritten in place — every downstream transformation is a code step producing a new file in `data/interim/` or `data/processed/`, never an in-place mutation of the source.

```bash
find data/raw -type f -not -name "MANIFEST.sha256" -exec sha256sum {} \; > data/raw/MANIFEST.sha256
# … later, before trusting a run against this data:
sha256sum -c data/raw/MANIFEST.sha256
```

Pass: every listed file reports `OK`. Fail: any `FAILED` line — a raw file changed after the manifest was written; treat this as data corruption, not a minor drift, and find out what touched it. Exclude the manifest file itself from the `find` — hashing the directory into a file that then sits inside that same directory makes the manifest describe its own pre-existence state, so a naive `find` that includes it always reports its own entry as `FAILED`.

```bash
git log --oneline -- data/raw | tail -n +2
```

Pass: no output (raw data was added once and never touched again in tracked history). Fail: any commit listed after the first — raw data is tracked in git and was modified post-ingest. Note: bulk raw data more often lives outside git entirely (object storage, DVC, a data lake), tracked only by the manifest hash above — this check applies when raw files are actually committed.

### `notebooks/` is never imported by `src/`

```bash
grep -rEn "^\s*(import|from)\s+.*notebooks" src/ 2>/dev/null
```

Pass: no output. Fail: any hit — a notebook has become a hidden dependency of production code. Extract the logic into `src/<pkg>/` and import it *into* the notebook, never the other way around.

Strip notebook outputs before every commit (`nbstripout`, or an equivalent pre-commit hook) — an un-stripped notebook diff buries the one line of code that changed under megabytes of re-rendered cell output, and review becomes theater. Grey zone: judge by whether `git diff` on a notebook stays legible; if it never does, the repo is missing the strip step.

### One run = one committed config

A run's config file is its identity — never a shared mutable "current settings" file edited in place between runs. See `references/training.md` for the full experiment-tracking contract (config hash, git SHA, data manifest hash, logged together).

```bash
ls configs/*.yaml | wc -l
```

Pass: one file per meaningfully distinct run, growing over the project's life. Fail: a single `config.yaml` that gets overwritten for every new run — there is no way to recover what config produced last week's number.

## Grey zones

- A `notebooks/` file that produces a stakeholder-facing report (a figure, a summary table) rather than code is fine to keep as a notebook indefinitely — the "never imported by `src/`" rule targets logic reuse, not one-off reporting.
- A tiny CRUD-style project with one model and one dataset may collapse `data/interim/` into `data/processed/` when there is genuinely no intermediate derivation step — judge by whether a reader could reconstruct the pipeline's stages from the folder names alone; if yes, the collapse is fine.
- `experiments/` output is gitignored by default, but a small number of final, reported-on run directories may be committed deliberately (e.g. under `experiments/reported/`) when the team wants those specific results version-controlled — the default stays gitignored; this is an explicit, scoped exception, not a silent one.

## Incumbent-respect clause
Detect the project's existing layout before changing anything: inspect its dependency declaration, lockfile, environment manager, package shape, and `configs/` or `data/` convention. Follow that incumbent shape for edits inside an established project. Apply the `pyproject.toml` + locked dependencies + importable-package recipe to new projects and explicitly scoped package migrations only; never restructure an existing project's layout inside an unrelated feature or experiment change.

## Hand-offs

- Dataset construction, splitting, and leakage prevention → `references/datasets.md`.
- Training-run discipline and experiment tracking → `references/training.md`.
- Suite-level test placement and structure beyond the `tests/` mirror rule above → the `principle-testing` skill.
- Per-file Python discipline (typing, the 250-LOC ceiling, TDD loop) → the `principle-programming` skill.
