# Rule: {Convention Title}

<!--
PURPOSE: Specify a standing convention — an ongoing constraint that applies to all
work in this area, not scoped to a single feature or decision event.

A rule answers "what must we always do?" — the operational guidance.
If the user explicitly asked for a decision record, link the governing ADR in
frontmatter. Otherwise, keep the local rationale here.

This file is alive as long as the convention holds. Deprecate (do not delete)
when the convention is retired.
-->

## Rule

<!-- State the convention as a present-tense imperative. Be specific enough that
     compliance is unambiguous. -->

## Rationale

<!-- Brief explanation of why this rule exists. For a full decision record,
     link to the governing ADR rather than restating it here. -->

<!-- Governing ADR: docs/decisions/{governing-adr}.md -->

## Scope

<!-- Which parts of the codebase, team, or workflow this rule applies to. -->

## Examples

### Compliant

```text
{show a concrete compliant example}
```

### Non-compliant

```text
{show a concrete violation and explain why it fails}
```

## Exceptions

<!-- Conditions under which the rule does not apply, if any. "None" is a valid answer. -->

## Enforcement

<!-- How compliance is verified: CI check, code review, hook, convention-only, etc. -->
