# Bundled first-run installer for the git-guard checks.
#
# Scaffolds the guard scripts into the TARGET repo and registers the pre-commit
# checks as .githooks/guards.d/ entries. The target repository owns core.hooksPath
# and .githooks/pre-commit; this installer never writes either. Also installs
# .githooks/pre-push directly if absent, preserving existing hooks.
# This is the single entry point the `worktree` reference (git
# skill) and `init` skill delegate to.
#
# Safe to re-run: existing files are never clobbered, and the git config / chmod
# performed by setup-hooks.sh are idempotent.

# Run from anywhere inside the target repo:
#   sh /path/to/skills/git/scripts/install.sh
