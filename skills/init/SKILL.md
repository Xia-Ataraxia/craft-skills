description: Maps a repository into a maintained hierarchical AGENTS.md knowledge base. Use when asked to "init this repo" for AGENTS, deep-init a codebase, generate or update AGENTS.md, map repository conventions, audit existing AGENTS coverage, or report stale managed AGENTS regions. Not for package-manager or plugin initialization, docs scaffolding or authoring (use `document`), or git-hook installation (use `git`).

# init

Map a repository into a maintained hierarchical `AGENTS.md` knowledge base with evidence-backed placements and preserved incumbent instructions.

## Output contract

Return the written or read-only audit result with the affected `AGENTS.md` paths, evidence sources, managed-region status, and unavailable paths.
If paths are unreadable, scope evidence is ambiguous, or a managed region was hand-edited, stop and report the condition without overwriting incumbent content.
A sibling `CLAUDE.md` may exist only as an adapter whose bytes are exactly `@AGENTS.md` plus one LF.

Placement and content are judgment, so they live in this file as prose.
Only one step is fragile enough to be executable: editing a marker-delimited region without disturbing surrounding bytes.

## Invocation

| Request | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `init`, or `init map` | Map the repository: inventory, choose placements, write managed regions. |
| `init audit` | Report current state read-only. Never write. |
| `init report-stale` | Name managed regions no longer backed by a placement. Never delete. |

Bare `init` means map. Do not ask which mode was intended, and do not treat bare `init` as a selector.
`audit` and `report-stale` require their explicit words.

## Map

Work top down and stop as soon as the repository is described.

1. **Inventory.** Read the tree without following symlinks. Note first-party directories, their file types, declared entry points, and configuration files. Skip `.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`, `build`, `__pycache__`, and comparable vendored or generated trees.
2. **Preflight mutable tools.** Before recording a tool-dependent instruction, follow [tool preflight](references/tool-preflight.md) and keep unavailable or unsupported command surfaces explicit.
3. **Place the root.** A root `AGENTS.md` always exists.
4. **Place a child only on evidence.** Add a nested `AGENTS.md` when a directory owns its own build or dependency configuration, presents a distinct entry boundary, and holds enough code that root guidance would be wrong there. Prefer fewer files. A directory that merely holds many files is not a scope.
5. **Write content that a newcomer could not infer.** Commands actually declared in that scope, entry points, local conventions, and constraints. Cite the file each claim comes from. Never invent a command; if no command is declared, say so.
6. **Do not repeat the parent.** A child file adds only what differs from the instruction chain above it.
7. **Install each payload** as a managed region using the script below.

Keep a root file within roughly 50-150 lines and a child file within roughly 30-80.
When evidence exceeds that, summarize and state the omitted count rather than truncating silently.

## Audit

Report, without writing anything: which `AGENTS.md` files exist, which managed regions are present and internally consistent, which scopes look uncovered, and which paths could not be read.
State loading behavior as unknown unless a runtime probe actually demonstrated it.
Never infer loading from directory placement or from a successful map.

## Report stale

Name any managed region whose scope no longer warrants a placement, then stop.
`init` has no deletion authority: removing a file or a region is the user's decision, and hand-editing is fine because the region markers make ownership visible.

## The one script

```sh
python3 skills/init/scripts/agents_region.py <path> --id <region-id> --payload-file <file|->
```

It replaces exactly one `<!-- init:managed id=... -->` region, or appends one when the file has none, and preserves every other byte plus the file mode.
It refuses symlinks, non-regular files, non-UTF-8 content, and files holding two regions with the same id.
The hash in each opening marker is checked before any rewrite, so a region someone edited by hand is refused rather than overwritten; resolve that edit first, either by keeping the human text outside the markers or by folding it into the payload.
Exit `0` on success with a JSON receipt, `2` on refusal with a JSON error.
Rerunning it with the same payload is a byte-identical no-op.

Use one stable id per scope, for example `init-root` or `init-<directory>`.

## Safety and canonicality

Before working on a path, read every `AGENTS.md` from the repository root through that path's directory in order; the nearest instruction wins on conflict.
This reading rule is instruction, not proof of how a runtime loads files.

Existing content is never silently adopted, overwritten, or deleted.
This holds inside the markers too: a hand-edited region is reported, not rewritten.
When a file already holds substantive instructions, keep them: the script appends rather than replacing, and consolidating them into managed content requires the user's agreement.
When a `CLAUDE.md` holds anything other than the exact adapter bytes, migrate its content into `AGENTS.md` with the user's agreement before installing the adapter.

## Boundaries

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|
| AGENTS placement, content, canonicality, audit, and stale reporting | **init** |
| Documentation scaffolding, README, ADRs, and substantive docs content | `document` |
| Git hooks and enforcement rails | `git` |
| Package, plugin, or ecosystem initialization | Outside init |

## Requirements

- `python3` — official source: <https://docs.python.org/3/>; safe probe: `python3 --version`; support boundary: Python 3.10+ for the region script and its test module.
- Dependency trigger — a selected Python release or a changed probe result requires official-documentation review and rerunning `python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/init/tests -p 'test_*.py'` before trusting this recipe.
- [Tool preflight](references/tool-preflight.md) records mutable CLI probes, support boundaries, incompatibilities, and official-update plus sibling-repair outcomes.

## Anti-patterns

- Asking whether bare `init` meant map → bare `init` is map.
- Deleting a file or region because it looks stale → report it and let the user decide.
- Overwriting incumbent instructions to install managed content → preserve them and ask.
- A nested `AGENTS.md` that exists only because a directory has many files → require configuration, an entry boundary, and real weight.
- Restating parent guidance in a child file → keep only the local difference.
- Claiming a command that no configuration declares → cite the source file or omit it.
- Editing a managed region with ad-hoc string replacement → use the script.
- Reporting loader behavior as known without a probe → say unknown.
