# agents

Build and change LLM-agent behavior under one discipline: prove it with an eval first, version the prompt as code second, bound the context third. A change is done when its eval case passes, its prompt lives in a diffable file, and its run is traceable by a `run_id`.

## PHASE 0 — work-type gate

Read the matching reference in full before writing a prompt, adding a tool, or shipping any behavior change.

| Work type | Read (in order) |
|---|---|
| Agent/LLM-feature behavior change — new agent, prompt edit, tool schema, selection, behavior, or routing change | `references/evals.md` |
| Prompt or tool authoring — itself a behavior change, not a separate lane | `references/evals.md`, then `references/prompts-tools.md` |
| Retrieval, memory, or observability wiring | `references/context-tracing.md` |
| Model training or fine-tuning | stop — load `ml` instead |

Apply the three core laws below plus the matching reference's iron list.

## Core laws

### Eval-first

No agent-behavior change ships without an eval set and stated pass criteria — a prompt edit, a tool-logic change, and a routing change are all behavior changes. Evals are versioned data files committed alongside the code they gate, never a notebook run once and discarded.

**Detect** — a diff touching prompts or agent code with no corresponding eval change:

```bash
git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD | grep -qE '(^|/)(prompts?|agents?)/.*\.(py|ts|md|txt|jinja)$' \
  && { git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD | grep -qE '(^|/)evals?/' || echo "FLAG: behavior change with no evals/ touched"; }
```

Pass: no `FLAG` line. Fail: `FLAG` printed — the change is blocked until an eval case covers it (see `references/evals.md`). This command is a floor, not a ceiling: it only greps `prompts?/`/`agents?/` paths and misses a behavior change landing in `src/` or a framework module — judge by whether the diff alters agent behavior, not by path alone.

### Prompts are code

A prompt is source code. Keep a small, local prompt with its implementation; externalize it to a versioned `prompts/` file when it needs reuse, an independent diff, localization, or an escape from a vendor dashboard. A vendor dashboard copy is a deployment target, not the source of truth.

### LLM output is untrusted input

A completion, a tool-call argument, a generated query — whatever the model produces carries no more trust than the least-trusted content that fed into generating it. This skill owns the behavior contract; `security` owns validation, allowlists, permissions, execution controls, and consumption caps. Before shipping code that acts on model output, load the `security` skill for its parse/validate/limit pattern.

### Runtime facts are verified

When an agent, model API, SDK, eval runner, or hosted service depends on an unknown, ambiguous, or version-dependent fact, consult its official primary documentation first. Disclose conflicting evidence; a target-specific repo-local contract or reproducible evidence on the matching version and platform outranks general or stale documentation. An unresolved fact stays unknown: stop the dependent behavior or use its established safe fallback, never invent an endpoint, option, or capability.

## Hand-offs

- Prompt-injection defense, output-execution hardening, tool allowlists, permissions, execution controls, and consumption caps (plus their detection commands) → `security` — this skill owns tool schemas, selection, and behavior; `security` owns enforcement.
- Model training or fine-tuning → `ml`.
- Serving the model or agent behind an API → `backend`.
- Deterministic, model-free business logic (unit/integration tests) → `testing`.
- Creating, updating, renaming, or retiring a skill in this library, including this one → follow the Lifecycle section of docs/skills/authoring.md. This skill does not author or manage library packages.

## Requirements

- A plain Python or TypeScript client for the model API under test — no framework required to exercise any rule in this skill.
- `git`, `grep`, `awk`, `find` for the detection commands above and in `references/`.
- An eval runner that can replay a golden set against pass criteria — a plain script is sufficient.

## Verification

- [ ] PHASE 0 routed to the matching reference before the change was written.
- [ ] The behavior change has a corresponding eval case (golden-set diff or new case) in the same change.
- [ ] Prompt placement follows the reviewability decision: externalize only when reuse, an independent diff, localization, or dashboard escape needs it.
- [ ] Tool schemas, selection, and behavior changes have eval coverage.
- [ ] Model-output validation, permissions, execution controls, and consumption caps were reviewed via the `security` skill, not re-implemented here.
