# Lint-first simplification

Making an existing package smaller and clearer by moving as much of the work as possible into linter configuration, and reserving hand judgment for what the linter cannot express.
Configuration beats a bespoke script: it runs in CI already, and the next person edits one file rather than learning a private tool.
The rule codes below come from one Python linter and are illustrative — consult the incumbent linter's official documentation for what each rule means and fixes in the installed version before enabling it.
Preserve the target repository's incumbent linter and formatter configuration; this reference covers only how a refactor pass drives it.

## Inputs

- The linter's currently selected rule sets.
- The target package; the rest of the repository is scoped out with per-file ignores rather than by narrowing the global selection.
- A green suite and a clean contract check before starting, per the safety protocol in `../SKILL.md`.

## Ordered steps

1. **Measure before enabling.**
   For each candidate rule set, count its hits on the target package alone and record the number.

   ```bash
   <linter> check --select <RULESET> <package>/ | tail -1
   ```

   A worked measurement across one package: `SIM` 15, `C4` 3, `PIE` 1, `RET` 3, `PERF` 6, `RUF` 154 of which 106 were unused-suppression findings, `FURB` 4, `ISC` 11.
   The distribution is the point — one set dominated the count and most of that set was a single rule, which changes what is worth enabling.
2. Enable only the sets whose hits are genuine improvements.
   Prefer per-file ignores for tests, scripts, and other packages over dropping a rule globally, and write the reason next to each ignore.
3. Apply the autofixes and commit them **alone**: configuration plus mechanical rewrites, nothing else.
   Read the unsafe-fix diff before applying any of it, and apply unsafe fixes per rule rather than wholesale.
4. Run the suite.
   Revert any autofix that flips a test and record it as a per-file ignore or an inline suppression with its reason.
5. Do the hand pass for what lint cannot express — duplicate helpers, dead code, recomputation inside a loop, copy-pasted blocks — strictly behavior-preserving, and commit it separately.
6. State explicitly what was *skipped* and why: cross-package deduplication that would breach an import contract, arithmetic that changes rendered output, metric semantics.

Two commits, not one: mechanical and judgment changes reviewed together means the judgment changes are not reviewed.
A worked split ran 165 files at +579/−537 for the mechanical commit and 20 files at +147/−244 for the hand commit.

## Autofix review in a refactor pass

Read every autofix diff against these failure classes before committing it:

| Class | Risk and check |
|---|---|
| Justification stripping | Removing an unused suppression also removes its reason; inspect deleted comment text and retain decision context. |
| Literal reshaping | Joining or normalizing literals can break source scanners despite identical runtime values; search checks and fixtures for the post-fix literal and preserve deliberate splits. |
| Order pinning | Sorting exports or declarations can break mirrors, snapshots, checksums, or generators; identify the external ordering contract and scope the rule out of vendored/generated trees. |
| Presence-only symbols | Removing a locally unused import or binding can erase a re-export, registration, or fixture alias; search repository-wide callers and check side effects. |
| Half-applied rewrites | Simplifying one half can orphan bindings, conditions, or comments; rerun the full linter and review the whole construct, not just the selected rule. |

Scope an unsafe rule out narrowly with its reason rather than changing a test to accept the break.
These classes are why step 3 commits configuration and autofix alone: a mechanical commit that has to be partly reverted is far cheaper to unpick than a mixed one.

Two constraints are specific to a refactor pass rather than to the configuration:

- Keep the formatter out of it.
  A repository with a large unformatted surface produces a format sweep big enough to bury the simplification it was bundled with; adopt the formatter separately, one coherent scope per change, widening the checked scope as each becomes conformant.
- Do not stack unrelated packages.
  When a repository-wide rule floods a package that is not the target, scope it with a per-file ignore and record it as follow-up rather than widening the pass.

## Success criteria

- The linter passes across the whole repository, not just the target package.
- The suite has no real failures, and every import contract is still kept.
- Exactly two commits: configuration plus autofix, then hand edits.
- The change description names the enabled rule sets and the before-and-after hit counts.
  A worked result: 307 findings repository-wide reduced to 0 by configuration and autofix, then a small hand pass, ending with 3971 tests passing, a clean linter, and 11 of 11 contracts kept.
