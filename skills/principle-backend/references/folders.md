# Backend Folder Conventions

The folder tree is the architecture made visible — pick the tree that matches the chosen pattern (see `layered.md`, `vertical-slice.md`, `hexagonal.md`) and keep tests, migrations, and config in the place that tree implies.

## Where tests, migrations, and config live

| Concern | Layered | Vertical-slice | Hexagonal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests | mirrored `tests/` tree, one dir per layer (or colocated — see the `principle-testing` skill for the placement decision) | colocated inside each feature slice | colocated per component; use-case tests run against in-memory fakes of each port, not a real database |
| Migrations | `db/migrations/` at the repo root, shared across layers | `db/migrations/` at the repo root, shared across slices | `adapters/persistence/migrations/` — the adapter owns them, never the domain |
| Config | `configs/` (or `config/`) at the repo root, one file per environment | same | same, but the domain never reads config directly; an adapter reads it and passes a typed value through a port |

## Architecture-shape candidates

```bash
have_layered=$(find ./src -maxdepth 2 -type d \( -iname controllers -o -iname services -o -iname repositories \) | wc -l)
have_slice=$(find ./src -maxdepth 1 -type d -iname features | wc -l)
have_hex=$(find ./src -maxdepth 2 -type d \( -iname domain -o -iname ports -o -iname adapters \) | wc -l)
echo "layered=$have_layered slice=$have_slice hexagonal=$have_hex"
```

Two or more nonzero counts flag a candidate for investigation, not proof of mixed architecture. Confirm the service manifest, entrypoint, and import direction; only a confirmed mixed dependency direction warrants a dedicated migration, never a silent feature-side edit.

## Repo topology in a GitOps split

When application source and cluster manifests live in separate repositories (a manifests/GitOps repo plus one or more app-source repos), each repo carries only its own concern:

- A manifests repo carries zero application source — only Kubernetes/Kustomize YAML (`base/`, `overlays/`), Helm charts, and the thin scripts that render them.
- An app repo never embeds cluster manifests beyond its own `deploy/` directory (a base overlay reference or a chart values file scoped to that one service) — the manifests repo is the sole owner of cross-cutting cluster topology (per-environment overlays, ingress rules, cluster-wide policy).

```bash
# Manifests repo: application source must not exist outside a thin scripts/ dir
find . -name '*.py' -o -name '*.ts' -o -name '*.go' | grep -v -E '^\./scripts/'
```

Any hit is application source leaked into a manifests-only repo. Move it to the owning app repo.

```bash
# App repo: cluster manifests must stay inside deploy/
find . -maxdepth 2 -iname 'kustomization.yaml' -not -path './deploy/*'
```

Any hit outside `deploy/` is a cluster manifest creeping into the app repo. Move it to the manifests repo, or into `deploy/` if it is genuinely scoped to this one service.

## Incumbent-respect clause

Inspect the manifest, entrypoint, imports, and tree already in place, then match the established convention for new files. Introduce a new top-level folder only when it fits that confirmed architecture — not as a one-off convenience.
