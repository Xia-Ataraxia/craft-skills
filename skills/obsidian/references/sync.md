# Obsidian Sync

Operate `obsidian-headless` (`ob`) under one rule: every sync change is staged, evidenced, and reversible.
A first sync or repaired config starts in `pull-only`, runs once, and earns promotion to bidirectional continuous mode only after the local diff is plausible.

## Requirements

- `ob` from the `obsidian-headless` package
- `${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}` set independently on every machine
- Git or another tested point-in-time backup for each live vault
- A process supervisor such as pm2, systemd, or launchd for continuous replicas
- Optional `${OBSIDIAN_SYNC_REMOTE_HOST}` and `${OBSIDIAN_SYNC_PROCESS_NAME}` for remote daemon operations

## Boundaries

Use this skill for the headless `ob` client, its local/remote vault pairing, sync modes, and daemon lifecycle.
Discover the official `obsidian-cli` skill by package identity for note reads and writes, and for read-only Sync state on a vault the desktop app already syncs (`sync:status`, `sync:history`, `diff filter=sync`); invoke its `obsidian` executable. The native skill owns CLI mechanics, while this reference owns only headless Sync coordination. Use [`doctor.md`](doctor.md) for plugins and templates, and the desktop app for GUI Sync settings.
If the native skill, executable, app bridge, or requested read-only command is unavailable, report that gap rather than treating `ob` as a replacement for the desktop-app surface.
Apply the local [result-evidence boundary](cli.md#result-evidence) to desktop-app responses; empty output is not proof of a healthy pairing or absent content.
Apply the [package's write-authority boundary](../SKILL.md#boundaries) to content probes as well as ordinary edits; Sync access does not authorize a test-note write.
Preserve the observed supervisor and the separate Git backup mechanism through [daemon operations](sync-daemon-operations.md); pairing or restart work does not authorize replacing either.
Do not use `mirror-remote` as a shortcut for conflict resolution.

## Topology

Assign roles before running a command:

- **Primary**: the machine whose vault state is authoritative for the operation. It may run the Obsidian desktop app.
- **Replica**: a machine running `ob`; a continuous replica must not run the desktop app against the same vault concurrently.
- **Remote service**: the Obsidian Sync vault. Confirm it still exists before changing a local pairing.

Resolve `${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}` separately on each machine.
Never copy an absolute path from one host to another; `ob` keys local configuration by the literal path, including its casing.
A remote-vault pairing selects a synchronization destination, not an account-credential isolation boundary.
Do not infer separate credentials or permissions from different vault IDs, local paths, device names, or supervisor processes.
If credential isolation is required, verify the native capability and actual credential scope without exposing secrets; report the gap rather than claiming the pairing provides it.

## Workflow

### Incident branch

If the signal is a large or unexplained deletion set, stop every Sync client and load [`sync-recovery.md`](sync-recovery.md) before running normal Preflight.
Do not create a normal pre-sync tag and treat the already-damaged tree as a restore point.
Preserve forensic evidence outside the vault, identify a known-good recovery source, and return to the staged workflow only after the incident is resolved and verified under the recovery authority boundary.

### 1. Preflight

1. Identify the primary, replica, target remote vault, and expected direction of change.
2. Stop `ob sync --continuous` and close the Obsidian desktop app on the replica.
3. Create a rollback point on every affected vault. For a Git-backed vault:

   ```bash
   git -C "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" status --short
   git -C "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" tag "safety/ob-sync-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
   ```

   Do not stage or commit unrelated changes merely to make the snapshot look clean.

4. Record baseline evidence:

   ```bash
   find "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" -name '*.md' -not -path '*/.git/*' | wc -l
   git -C "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" status --short
   ob sync-list-remote
   ob sync-list-local
   ```

5. Confirm the intended remote vault exists. Stop when the target is absent or ambiguous.
6. Verify the exact local path and casing with `ob sync-status --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}"`.

### 2. Stage in pull-only mode

Run setup in a real TTY because the end-to-end encryption password prompt is interactive:

```bash
ob sync-setup \
  --vault "<vault-id-or-name>" \
  --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" \
  --device-name "<replica-name>"
ob sync-config --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" --mode pull-only
```

If a stale config points to the wrong path, inspect it first, then unlink only that exact path:

```bash
ob sync-list-local
ob sync-unlink --path "<verified-stale-path>"
```

Never pipe credentials, place them in arguments, or run setup through a non-interactive SSH command.

### 3. Run once and verify

Run one bounded sync, preserving the command status while recording output:

```bash
set -o pipefail
ob sync --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" | tee "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ob-sync-first-run.log"
```

Verify all of the following before promotion:

- The Markdown file-count delta is explained by known drift.
- `git status --short` shows a plausible set of changes rather than a broad wipe.
- The log has no authentication, missing-vault, or repeated transport errors.
- `ob sync-status --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}"` reports the intended device and `pull-only` mode.
- A representative sample of changed files opens and contains expected content.

Stop the workflow when any check is unexplained.
Follow [sync-recovery.md](sync-recovery.md); do not “try bidirectional” to see whether it heals itself.

### Content roundtrip evidence

File counts, plausible diffs, and a live process are safety and liveness signals, not proof that authorized content completed a roundtrip.
For a requested end-to-end check, use an exact note and reversible content change admitted by the [write-authority owner](../SKILL.md#boundaries), preserving its provenance and protected content.
Read back the actual content on the source and receiving replica after synchronization; where bidirectional behavior is in scope, make the authorized return change on the replica and read it back on the source.
Use only the direction already admitted: a pull-only run cannot prove a return trip and does not authorize promotion merely to complete a test.
Restore probe content only within the same approved effect and verify that restoration across the participating replicas; do not silently delete a probe note.
Record the paths, direction, observed content or privacy-safe content identity, and any unverified leg.
Without note authority, a native write surface, or access to a receiving replica, report a partial check rather than inventing a successful roundtrip.
Keep [restart recovery and remote-backup readback](sync-daemon-operations.md#health-evidence) as separate evidence.

### 4. Promote deliberately

After the one-shot result is accepted:

```bash
ob sync-config --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" --mode bidirectional
ob sync --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}"
```

Verify the second one-shot run, then start continuous mode under the selected supervisor:

```bash
ob sync --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}" --continuous
```

Use [daemon-operations.md](sync-daemon-operations.md) for supervisor configuration and remote inspection.

## Daily operations

Prefer read-only inspection before restart or reconfiguration:

```bash
ob sync-status --path "${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH}"
ob sync-list-local
```

For a remote replica, resolve the host and process explicitly:

```bash
: "${OBSIDIAN_SYNC_REMOTE_HOST:?set replica host}"
: "${OBSIDIAN_SYNC_PROCESS_NAME:?set supervisor process name}"
ssh "${OBSIDIAN_SYNC_REMOTE_HOST}" \
  'ob sync-status --path "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH" && pm2 describe "$OBSIDIAN_SYNC_PROCESS_NAME"'
```

A mode change, unlink, setup, or daemon-definition change repeats Preflight and the one-shot Verify gate.
A restart alone does not justify changing configuration.

## Mode selection

| Mode | Behavior | Admission |
|---|---|---|
| `pull-only` | Downloads remote changes; remote deletions still apply locally. | Required for first sync and repaired pairings. |
| `bidirectional` | Uploads local changes and downloads remote changes. | Only after a clean one-shot pull and reviewed diff. |
| `mirror-remote` | Reverts local-only state to match the remote. | Explicit destructive intent plus a tested rollback point. |

## Failure triage

| Signal | Interpretation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `The connected remote vault no longer exists` or `Vault not found` | The stored remote identifier is stale or deleted. | Re-run `sync-list-remote`; do not reuse the stale pairing. |
| `Failed to validate password` | Wrong passphrase or no interactive TTY. | Re-run setup in a real terminal; do not pass the secret on the command line. |
| Restart count rises continuously | Authentication, binary, native-module, path, or supervisor failure. | Stop the process and inspect stderr before restarting again. |
| Files appear absent only over SSH on macOS | The shell may lack Full Disk Access. | Verify locally on the replica or through an authorized process before diagnosing data loss. |
| Large unexplained deletion set | Remote deletion, wrong path, race, or corrupt state. | Stop all sync clients and execute the recovery procedure. |

## Anti-patterns

- Treating `pull-only` as deletion-proof → remote deletions still propagate; keep a rollback point and inspect the diff.
- Running the desktop app and `ob --continuous` on the same replica vault → choose one sync client per vault at a time.
- Restarting a supervisor from a stale ecosystem file → inspect the live process definition and restart by the registered process name.
- Guessing that a remote vault still exists → `ob sync-list-remote` is a mandatory preflight check.
- Copying one host’s vault path into another host’s config → resolve and verify the exact path independently.
- Repeatedly restarting a crash loop → stop it, read the first error, fix the cause, then perform one controlled restart.

## Verification

- [ ] Every affected vault has a named rollback point created before mutation.
- [ ] The target remote vault exists and the exact local path is verified.
- [ ] A one-shot `pull-only` run completed before bidirectional or continuous mode.
- [ ] File-count, Git diff, logs, and representative files agree with the expected change.
- [ ] The desktop app is not racing the headless client on the replica.
- [ ] Supervisor status and recent logs show a stable heartbeat with a low restart count.
- [ ] Requested content roundtrip, scoped restart recovery, and remote-backup readback have distinct observed results or explicit gaps.
