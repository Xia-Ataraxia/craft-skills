description: 'Diagnoses a failing program under a hypothesis-driven loop: reproduce the failure before theorizing, log observed facts separately from inferences, hold competing hypotheses until the cheapest probe discriminates between them, and confirm the mechanism with instrumentation before any fix lands. Use when a test or command fails for an unclear reason, a bug needs bisecting to the commit or input that caused it, a failure only reproduces intermittently, or asked to find out why something is broken ("이거 왜 안 되는지 찾아줘"). Not for restructuring working code (use refactor), suite-level test architecture (use principle-testing), or triaging a vulnerability class (use security).'

# debug

Diagnose why code is broken under one loop: establish observed evidence, log fact separately from inference, hold competing hypotheses only while evidence is ambiguous, and instrument only when existing evidence cannot confirm the mechanism. Done means the failure is reproducible on command or directly established by deterministic evidence, the fix is proven by a failing-then-passing regression test and real user scenario, and every temporary artifact is removed.

## The loop

1. **Establish evidence.** Reproduce the failure on demand and capture the exact invocation and output. A deterministic failing test, stack trace, or static contract violation may seed the first hypothesis when it directly establishes the failure. If it only fails sometimes, run it N times and record the failure rate instead of guessing — an unreproduced bug is a report, not yet a debugging target.
2. **Log evidence, not conclusions.** Runtime evidence outranks plausible code reading. Keep two columns as you go: `Observed` (a command, a stack-trace line, a log entry — verbatim) and `Inferred` (what it's believed to mean). Never write an inference into the observed column; a hypothesis that turns out wrong should trace back to the specific inference that produced it, not get tangled into the facts.
3. **Hold competing hypotheses when evidence is ambiguous.** Write down at least two candidate explanations only when the observed facts leave more than one plausible mechanism. For the next step, ask "which probe kills one hypothesis but not the other?" and run that one — not the one that would merely confirm the favorite. When direct evidence isolates a mechanism, follow it rather than inventing alternatives.
4. **Bisect the search space.** Pick the axis that fits the failure:
   - **Temporal** — a regression between a known-good and known-bad commit: `git bisect start`, `git bisect bad`, `git bisect good <sha>`, then `git bisect run <cmd>` with a script that exits 0/1 against the reproduction command, non-interactive end to end.
   - **Input** — a large or complex failing input: halve it, keep whichever half still reproduces, repeat until the input is minimal.
   - **Layer** — a multi-hop pipeline (client → gateway → service → DB): probe the midpoint first to learn which half owns the fault, then recurse into that half only.
5. **Instrument only when evidence cannot discriminate.** When the existing evidence cannot prove or disprove the leading hypothesis, add the smallest probe that can — a log line, an assertion, or a debugger breakpoint — and run it. Touch source once the mechanism is confirmed by observed evidence, not merely suspected from reading the code.
6. **Fix, prove, clean up.** Write the fix once the mechanism is confirmed. Per `principle-testing`'s prove-it law, add a regression test that fails against the pre-fix code and passes against the post-fix code (red, then green) in the same change as the fix. After that test passes, exercise the real user-facing scenario too. Inventory every temporary artifact before creating it — files, processes, ports, environment changes, and debugger sessions — then remove each one before the diff lands; instrumentation is disposable, the regression test is not.

Escape hatch: reproduction is genuinely too expensive or too flaky to pin down (a rare race, a third-party outage) — timebox the search, act on the best-evidenced hypothesis, and say explicitly in the report which assumption stands unconfirmed.

## Count from durable artefacts, not logs

Absence in a log is not evidence of absence in the system.
A success path frequently emits no log line at all, so "nothing since boot" in a failure log can sit alongside a store holding 99 completed records; only counting the artefacts settles it.
Before treating any count as evidence, pin what produced it: the exact build under test, the data directory actually mounted — a wrong mount once measured a three-day-old directory as empty — the depth of any work queue, since a draining backlog looks identical to new traffic, and the process restart count, since a restart resets in-memory state and masks the defect being hunted.
Re-check the restart count at the end of the window; if it moved, the measurement is void.

When existing signals cannot discriminate, the gap is usually attribution rather than volume.
A decision the system cannot explain is a decision nobody can triage: one detector fired 572 events per hour across 13 inputs and accumulated 8,060 artefacts that no one could act on, because each record stored a null trace id, a null policy id, a null module id, a null evidence link, and no score.
So when adding instrumentation, persist for every automated decision the score, the threshold applied, the policy or model identity, and a link to the evidence artefact it produced.
Make success countable rather than only emitting failures, and delete any counter nothing reads — one incremented on every dropped unit and read nowhere made a silent drop look identical to a healthy stream.
`principle-programming` owns log level, placement, and structured-field style; this skill owns what has to be recoverable afterwards.

## Principles

- [Fix Root Causes](references/fix-root-causes.md): trace each symptom to its root cause and fix it there; reproduce first, ask why until you reach it, resist nil-check guards that silence crashes.
- [Attack the Premise](references/attack-the-premise.md): when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate, take a census of which actors hold the imbalance before the next fix, then question the premise instead of writing another fix that assumes it.

## Hand-offs

- The fix needs restructuring beyond the minimal patch (extract, rename, deduplicate) → `refactor`.
- The regression test's placement in the suite (unit vs. integration, fixture scope) → `principle-testing`.
- The root cause is a vulnerability class (injection, auth bypass, secret exposure), not a defect → `security`.

## Anti-patterns

- Concluding an event never happened because its log has no entry → count the durable artefacts; a success path often logs nothing.
- Reading counts from a running system without first pinning the build, mount, queue depth, and restart count → a wrong mount, a draining backlog, or a mid-window restart each produce a confident wrong number.
- Adding a counter or trace field that nothing reads → drop it or wire it to a consumer; an unread counter makes a silent failure look healthy.
- Recording that an automated decision fired without its score, threshold, deciding policy, and evidence link → persist all four, or the event cannot be triaged later.
- Waiting passively for a long measurement window to end → wait in an active loop that terminates in the final count, or the run is abandoned unfinished.

## Requirements

- `git` — bisect (step 4, temporal axis).
- The project's incumbent test runner for the regression test in step 6 (`pytest`, `vitest`, or equivalent).
