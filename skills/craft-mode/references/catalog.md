# Source catalog

This catalog maps every direct skill and every principle in pstack, pinned at cursor/plugins@d0ef80d86795816da932a153458c5dbe192d294e, to its place in this library.
Each row has three labels.
**Origin** is where the source came from.
**Current craft owner** is the package that already covered the topic before the import, or `none`.
**Craft destination** is where the source now lives.

**Kind** says how to reach it:

- **command**: a package you invoke by name.
- **reference**: a file read on demand by its owner or by craft-mode; it has no command of its own.
- **dropped**: no portable substance exists, so no file or command offers it.

Cross-package paths name the owning skill and its file.
Resolve them through that skill's discovery location.

## Direct skills

| Upstream skill | Origin | Current craft owner | Craft destination | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `poteto-mode` | pstack | none | `craft-mode` | command | Playbook router and working style; no persistent mode. |
| `poteto-help` | pstack | none | `craft-mode/references/usage.md` | reference | Router help, read by craft-mode. |
| `how` | pstack | none | `how` | command | Spawns read-only subagents: one explainer for a simple question, parallel explorers then an explainer for a complex one. |
| `why` | pstack | none | `why` | command | May compose how. |
| `recall` | pstack | none | `recall` | command | Mines the active workspace's recent transcripts with parallel subagents; reads another project's only when asked. |
| `blast-radius` | pstack | none | `blast-radius` | command | Proves the safety fact by running real code. |
| `architect` | pstack | none | `architect` | command | Grounds through how and why; explores with arena. |
| `arena` | pstack | none | `arena` | command | Parallel candidates on two model families, a judge from another family, then pick, graft, and verify. |
| `swarm` | pstack | none | `swarm` | command | Concurrency depends on runtime workers. |
| `interrogate` | pstack | none | `interrogate` | command | Uses whatever reviewers the runtime offers; no fixed model list. |
| `automate-me` | pstack | none | `automate-me` | command | Mines the active workspace's transcripts and asks the user, then drafts one personal mode skill and lands it through a PR. |
| `make-bot-ui` | pstack | none | none | dropped | Cursor-only backend; see [Unsupported boundaries](#unsupported-boundaries). |
| `setup-pstack` | pstack | none | `craft-mode/references/setup.md` | dropped | Model and budget configuration dropped by owner decision; the file documents native discovery only. |
| `reflect` | pstack | none | `reflect` | command | Three parallel reviewers read the active transcript or a session digest; edits wait for user approval, backlog items file automatically. |
| `correct` | pstack | none | `correct` | command | Fixes each repeated mistake class at the highest level that works, one commit per class, and proves each check fails on a real past mistake. |
| `teach` | pstack | none | `teach` | command | Composes how and why. |
| `tdd` | pstack | `programming` (now `principle-programming`), red-green TDD | `tdd` | command | Failing-first regression test when practical; otherwise the closest executable check, reported as such. |
| `benchmark-checklist` | pstack | none | `benchmark-checklist` | command | Applies `principle-testing/references/explain-the-number.md`. |
| `no-comments` | pstack | `programming` shortcut comments and `document` inline comments | `principle-programming/references/comments.md` | reference | Spawns one comment-review subagent with `principle-programming/references/comment-sicko.md` and acts on accepted findings. |
| `typescript-best-practices` | pstack | `programming` (now `principle-programming`) TypeScript reference | `principle-programming/references/typescript.md` and `principle-programming/references/typescript/patterns.md` | reference | Absorbed whole; upstream wins on conflicts. |
| `figure-it-out` | pstack | none | `figure-it-out` | command | Designs an auditable playbook when none fits. |
| `show-me-your-work` | pstack | none | `show-me-your-work` | command | Local decision log by default. |
| `create-verification-skill` | pstack | `testing` (now `principle-testing`) e2e guidance | `principle-testing/references/verification-skills.md` | reference | Writes a project-local `.agents/skills/verify-<app>/` skill with a feature map. |
| `maintain-verification-skill` | pstack | `testing` (now `principle-testing`) e2e guidance | `principle-testing/references/verification-skills.md` | reference | Read-only source subagents per feature, a live pass, then one PR of proven corrections or a clean or blocked report. |
| `unslop` | pstack | none | `unslop` | command | Always applies to prose; code and fixed machine formats are excluded. |
| `bro` | pstack | none | `bro` | command | Short plain-language restatement on request. |
| `technical-writing` | pstack | `document` | `document/references/technical-writing.md` | reference | Read by document for prose work. |

## Principles

Every principle file holds the upstream body verbatim, with frontmatter dropped and sibling links rewritten.
craft-mode's SKILL.md indexes all of them.

## Unsupported boundaries

`make-bot-ui` has no portable workflow, so no file or command offers it.
Every step depends on Cursor-only backend features: creating a webhook routine through `update_state`, collecting the sender key through a `SendToUser` secret-request card and its connector credential file, posting to a Cursor automation webhook URL, and waking on that routine's `webhook_event`.
Without that backend, the remaining local server and tailnet steps have nothing to wake.
Tailnet reachability on its own belongs to the `tailscale` skill.

`setup-pstack` configured per-role models and budgets for Cursor; the owner dropped that outcome.
No package pins a model or a budget.

Elsewhere, Cursor-only parts are removed and the portable outcome stays: Custom Mode persistence, fixed model tables, Cursor transcript paths, and Cursor's built-in skill authoring.

## Composition edges

[Playbooks](playbooks.md) owns the 23 playbooks and their workflow and principle edges.
These direct-skill edges are required:

- `teach` composes `how` and `why`.
- `architect` grounds through `how` and `why` and explores alternatives with `arena`.
- `benchmark-checklist` applies `principle-testing/references/explain-the-number.md`.
- `correct` applies `correct/references/encode-lessons-in-structure.md`.
