# craft-skills

Work-craft Agent Skills for research and engineering by Beomsu Koh.

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills)](https://github.com/Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills/releases/latest)

Own your craft, vendor-neutral: all 29 packages use the plain Agent Skills `SKILL.md` layout.
The portable core contains no runtime-specific behavior; Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Cursor, and Grok-native integration lives in runtime lenses and generated instruction-file adapters.
This is a task-oriented library for software and research work — kept separate from [`bstack`](https://github.com/GoBeromsu/bstack) (personal / life / second-brain automation) so the two domains never bleed into each other's context.

## Features

### Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `agents` | Build and change LLM-agent systems — prompts, tool schemas, context/tracing wiring — under an eval-first discipline that proves a behavior change against a versioned eval set before shipping. |
| `api` | Define contract-first public HTTP APIs with stable resource URLs, DTO-only success payloads, pagination, and diagnosable sanitized failures. |
| `browser` | Route browser work to Aside first, except when an explicit tool or an existing authenticated browser session is required; enforce safety preflight, recovery, and cleanup. |
| `ast-grep` | Search and replace code by syntax-tree shape with ast-grep, validating parseable patterns and inspecting a dry-run before mutation. |
| `backend` | Route backend engineering through an architecture-detection gate (layered / vertical-slice / hexagonal), then apply dependency-direction rules, persistence choices, and per-framework folder conventions. |
| `cicd` | Design inexpensive, reliable PR validation and reversible Jenkins Compose deployment pipelines with deployment-server-owned image builds. |
| `db` | Diagnose database issues and make schema and operational tradeoffs after the backend has selected the persistence stack and lifecycle. |
| `debug` | Diagnose a failing program under a hypothesis-driven loop — reproduce before theorizing, log fact separately from inference, and confirm the mechanism with instrumentation before any fix lands. |
| `defuddle` | Extract clean Markdown or metadata JSON from web articles and docs with the Defuddle CLI — strips nav/ads/boilerplate and falls back to a headless browser for JS-heavy pages. |
| `design` | Own root `DESIGN.md`, UX/UI judgment, bad-UX audits, and rendered evidence for material design work. |
| `distil` | Distil transferable rules and conventions from an external source — a repo, an article, an AGENTS.md, or a third-party skill — into the library under the authoring contract, with provenance recorded. |
| `document` | Scaffold and author repository documentation through the `docs/` ontology while keeping ADR authoring explicit-only unless the user asks to record a decision. |
| `frontend` | Gate frontend engineering on a rendering-architecture decision (SPA / SSR-RSC / SSG / islands) before UI code is written, then apply component-reuse, state-placement, and folder rules. |
| `git` | Guide version-control craft — ground-truth and incumbent-style detection, the atomic-commit split protocol, commit/branch/PR conventions, and non-interactive-safe history surgery, including the `git wt` worktree workflow. |
| `gpu` | Apply GPU environment and resource discipline — probe the hardware before choosing any install, budget the host before launching any job — to CUDA/PyTorch setup, attention-backend builds, and GPU job launches. |
| `guardrails` | Turn a convention into local, deterministic enforcement — runtime hooks, linter and formatter configuration, and pre-commit guards — so a violation is blocked before it happens, not corrected after. |
| `init` | Own the hierarchical `AGENTS.md` lifecycle as prose — map, read-only audit, stale reporting — with one script for marker-region edits; bare `init` runs ordinary deep-init. |
| `ml` | Apply ML/DL research-engineering discipline — reproducible project layout, leakage-safe dataset construction, and a training-discipline ladder — to classical ML, deep learning, fine-tuning, and vision work. |
| `obsidian` | Compose unchanged official native owners `obsidian-markdown`, `obsidian-bases`, `json-canvas`, and `obsidian-cli` for format and CLI mechanics, keeping only uncovered local app/Sync coordination and live-vault policy (its AGENTS.md and guidelines). |
| `orca` | Organize low-clutter work targets across hosts while preserving distinct Git identities and live sessions, safely clean old branches, and diagnose connection failures at their actual layer. |
| `programming` | Apply correctness-first, type-strict engineering discipline when writing or editing Python or TypeScript. |
| `refactor` | Restructure code without changing what it does, each move backed by a detection command and threshold, gated behind a characterization-test protocol for untested legacy code. |
| `research` | Run a decision-depth research workflow ending in a `docs/research/{slug}.md` artifact — sweep primary sources, synthesize with a citation on every claim, and state gaps and confidence, never the decision itself. |
| `security` | Find and fix vulnerabilities across web, API, and LLM surfaces, mapping every trust boundary first and triaging by production reachability and severity second. |
| `tailscale` | Verify and repair the Tailscale tailnet that carries cross-host work — SSH, remote process inspection, `scp` — before a dependent workflow runs, triaging failures as network-layer versus service-layer across macOS daemon variants. |
| `testing` | Architect and audit the test suite — classify each test by taxonomy and resource-based size, place it via a decision tree, and enforce the prove-it law that every bug fix ships with a failing-then-passing test. |
| `vmware` | Operate VMware Fusion guests through VM lifecycle checks and VNC-backed input automation. |
| `write-prd` | Author decision-ready product requirements documents from a provided or packaged template, keeping scope, metrics, rollout, and open issues coherent. |
| `write-report` | Scaffold and author a project's one-off canonical technical report against a single YAML frame whose depth is the enforced table of contents. |

## Installation

### Install and discovery

| Runtime | Vendor-native install or documented discovery path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Marketplace package |
| Codex | Plugin marketplace package; plain Agent Skills clone is auxiliary development context |
| Hermes | Standalone Hermes plugin |
| GJC (Gajae-Code) | Marketplace plugin; packages load from the installed plugin as `craft-skills:<name>` |
| Cursor | Project or user skills in `.cursor/skills`; plain Agent Skills discovery also supports `.agents/skills` |
| Grok-native | Skills in `.grok/skills` or a configured plugin path |
| Plain Agent Skills | One `SKILL.md` directory per skill under `.agents/skills` |

#### Claude Code — marketplace

Use the Claude Code marketplace channel:

```
/plugin marketplace add Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills
/plugin install craft-skills@craft-skills
```

Then invoke any of the 29 skills above by name, e.g. `api`, `ast-grep`, `defuddle`, `design`, `document`, `init`, `programming`, `research`, `write-prd`, `debug`, `orca`.

---

#### Codex — plugin or plain Agent Skills

The observed Codex plugin marketplace channel is:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills
codex plugin add craft-skills@craft-skills --json
```

Marketplace package metadata is tracked in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

For plain Agent Skills development context, clone into a project-root `.agents/skills` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills.git .agents/skills/craft-skills
```

The clone is optional development context; its skills have the nested layout `.agents/skills/craft-skills/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

---

#### Hermes — custom tap

Register the repository as a custom tap, then install each skill as one unit:

```bash
hermes skills tap add Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills
hermes skills install Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills/skills/<name>
hermes skills update            # pull upstream changes for every tap-installed skill
```

The tap scans every file in the unit; only a `safe` verdict installs without `--force`, so
every package is kept scanner-clean (see `docs/skills/verification.md`).

---

#### GJC — marketplace plugin

Register the marketplace once, then install the plugin:

```bash
gjc plugin marketplace add Xia-Ataraxia/craft-skills
gjc plugin install craft-skills@craft-skills
```

GJC scans the installed plugin directly and advertises every package as `craft-skills:<name>`,
so `/skill:craft-skills:obsidian` works with no further configuration.
Updates are one command:

```bash
gjc plugin upgrade
```

The installed plugin is the only copy; a manual copy alongside it outranks the plugin and freezes
(see the GJC row of the install matrix in `AGENTS.md`).

---

#### Cursor — documented skills directories

Cursor discovers project skills in `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; its Agent Skills compatibility also recognizes `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
Copy or link the individual plain skill directories there using the deployment mechanism appropriate for the project.
No Cursor plugin manifest or CLI command is provided by this repository.

#### Grok-native — documented skills or plugin configuration

Grok-native discovers plain skills at `.grok/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, or through its configured plugin path.
Use the vendor's configured plugin mechanism for the latter; this repository does not invent a Grok plugin manifest or command.

#### Plain Agent Skills layout

Each package is a self-contained `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
For a generic Agent Skills runtime, place the desired package directory at `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
The portable core is the same file used by every runtime; lenses hold runtime-specific guidance.

#### Operational deployment verification

For the approved `m1-pro` deployment, verify the discovered skill directories and runtime behavior only through the approved Tailscale/Orca SSH route.
This is operational verification guidance, not a vendor install command.

---

## Usage

After installation, skills are discovered by each runtime from their `SKILL.md` packages (GJC exposes them as `craft-skills:<name>`).

### Convenience Installer

The repository's convenience installer prints the observed Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes channels:

```bash
./install.sh codex    # print the Codex plugin commands
./install.sh codex --clone /path/to/project  # optionally clone development context
./install.sh hermes   # print the Hermes plugin command and profile-relative config snippet
./install.sh claude   # print the Claude Code marketplace commands
./install.sh all      # run all three
```

The script is idempotent and safe to re-run.

---

## Development

Each skill lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Author against `docs/skills/package-contract.md`; lifecycle and taste live in `docs/skills/authoring.md`; scoped verification lives in `docs/skills/verification.md`.

### Validation

`scripts/ci-local.sh` mirrors every required CI gate locally (pr-size, both Layer-1 validators, distribution-version, marketplace validation) and is the merge gate whenever GitHub Actions cannot run:

```bash
bash scripts/ci-local.sh
```

Enable the tracked git hooks once per clone — pre-commit runs the fast Layer-1 pair, pre-push runs the full mirror:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

`SKIP_LOCAL_CI=1` bypasses a hook once; `SKIP_MARKETPLACES=1` skips the claude/codex CLI job.
Individual checks can still be run directly (`claude plugin validate .`, `python3 scripts/governance/tools/validate_skill_format.py`, `python3 scripts/governance/tools/validate_runtime_hygiene.py`). Tests for those checks live under `scripts/governance/tests/`.

Codex reads the tracked plugin tree directly.
Hermes integration is covered by the isolated plugin install/load contract test under `scripts/governance/tests/`.
